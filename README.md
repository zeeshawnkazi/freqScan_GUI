# freqScan_GUI

A MATLAB GUI and library that measures pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance of diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers in wide-field. This code provides a front end with experimental controls, executes the pulse sequences and acquires images from a camera, saves the data and fits the ODMR resonance.
